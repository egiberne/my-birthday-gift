# Recap

I am grateful to have completed the Birthday Gift Page by applying key web development techniques, including:

- [ x] Controlling vertical **alignment** and **spacing** using `align-items` in a **flex** container.  
- [ x] Switching between **horizontal** and **vertical** layouts with `flex-direction: column`.  
- [ x] Using the **`:hover` pseudo-class** (`div:hover {}`) to add interactive hover effects.  
- [ x] Applying **background gradients** with `background: linear-gradient()` for smooth vertical transitions.  
- [ x] Grouping **selectors** (`h1, h2, h3 {}`) to apply shared styles and keep CSS concise.

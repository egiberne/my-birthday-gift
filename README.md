# Recap

I am grateful to have completed the Birthday Gift Page by applying key web development techniques:

- [x] Controlled vertical **alignment** and **spacing** using `align-items` in a **flex** container.  
- [x] Switched between **horizontal** and **vertical** layouts with `flex-direction: column`.  
- [x] Used the **`:hover` pseudo-class** (`div:hover {}`) to add interactive hover effects.  
- [x] Applied **background gradients** with `background: linear-gradient()` for smooth vertical transitions.  
- [x] Grouped **selectors** (`h1, h2, h3 {}`) to apply shared styles and keep CSS concise.
